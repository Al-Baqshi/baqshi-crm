**Case Study:** LebaList Platform\
**Company:** LebaList Technologies\
**Location:** Beirut, Lebanon\

### Process

Our collaboration with LebaList began with a comprehensive analysis of their multi-category marketplace requirements. Through intensive workshops with stakeholders and potential users, we identified the need for a unified platform supporting real estate, vehicles, general marketplace items, and construction supplies. Our team designed and implemented a scalable Progressive Web App (PWA) with role-based user management, advanced search and filtering capabilities, and integrated payment processing. We developed a robust backend API architecture supporting real-time notifications, media uploads, and external integrations including Facebook Marketplace synchronization.

### Outcome

The implementation delivered exceptional results, including a 70% reduction in listing creation time through streamlined workflows and a 85% improvement in user engagement through advanced search and filtering features. The integrated payment system with per-listing fees ($1/month) and per-tenant fees ($1 per rental agreement) achieved 95% payment success rate. The platform's mobile-first design and PWA capabilities resulted in 60% of transactions occurring on mobile devices. LebaList's comprehensive marketplace solution has established them as a leading platform for multi-category asset trading in the region.
