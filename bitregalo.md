1. Introduction
Overview of BitRegalo-F1 Protocol

In a world where control over our digital lives is increasingly slipping away into the hands of centralized authorities and third-party intermediaries, BitRegalo-F1 stands as a beacon of change. It is not just another protocol; it’s a revolution in how we manage our online identities, conduct transactions, and create digital ecosystems. BitRegalo-F1 is designed to give power back to the people, enabling individuals and businesses to operate securely and independently without the constant oversight of middlemen.The essence of BitRegalo-F1 lies in its commitment to decentralization, privacy, and user autonomy. By leveraging blockchain technology, the protocol ensures that every interaction, whether it’s logging in, transacting, or creating a digital entity, is secure, transparent, and fully under the user’s control. The days of depending on third-party services for critical aspects of your digital life are over; with BitRegalo-F1, you are the master of your digital destiny.

Purpose and Vision

The vision of BitRegalo-F1 is bold yet straightforward: to create a world where users no longer have to rely on intermediaries to manage their digital identities and operations. In this world, people can engage in online activities with full confidence that their information is secure, their identities are theirs alone, and their transactions are both transparent and trustworthy.BitRegalo-F1 aims to be the protocol that bridges the gap between today’s heavily centralized digital environment and the decentralized future we are all moving toward. Whether you are an individual looking to secure your online presence or a business aiming to streamline operations without sacrificing control, BitRegalo-F1 provides the tools and infrastructure necessary to make it happen.This protocol is built with the understanding that true digital freedom comes from self-sovereignty—the ability to manage your own identity, secure your own data, and control your own transactions. BitRegalo-F1 is not just about eliminating middlemen; it’s about creating a new paradigm where users are empowered to build, manage, and protect their digital lives on their own terms. Key Features of BitRegalo-F1’s Vision:

Security and Privacy: Provide a secure environment where all interactions are encrypted, private, and immune to unauthorized access.
User Autonomy: Empower users to manage their online presence and transactions without depending on third parties, enhancing both freedom and flexibility.
Transparency and Trust: Utilize blockchain technology to create a transparent system where all actions are traceable and verifiable, fostering trust between all participants.
Innovation  Scalability: Offer a flexible platform that supports a wide range of use cases and can scale as user needs evolve.
The BitRegalo-F1 protocol is designed to be a catalyst for change, ushering in a new era where digital interactions are more secure, more private, and entirely under the control of the user. It’s not just a protocol—it’s the foundation of the decentralized future.

2. Core Components of BitRegalo-F1
2.1 Decentralized Identity (DID) & KYC Tag

Decentralized Identity as an Entity:

In BitRegalo-F1, your decentralized identity acts as an entity. When you create a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request to Supply (RTS) without associating it with a specific entity, it automatically belongs to your main entity—your decentralized identity. Users can create additional entities, and these entities can create further entities, allowing for sophisticated management and hierarchical structuring of digital interactions.

2.1.1 Self-Sovereign Identity

At the heart of BitRegalo-F1 is the principle of self-sovereign identity (SSI). In today’s digital landscape, where data breaches and identity theft are rampant, relying on third parties to manage your identity is no longer a viable option. BitRegalo-F1 shifts the power dynamic, allowing individuals to take full control of their digital identities through Decentralized Identity (DID).

A DID is a self-owned, independent identity that does not rely on a centralized registry or authority. Instead, it is secured and verified on the blockchain, ensuring that it is immutable, tamper-proof, and entirely under the user’s control. This means that you, and only you, decide how your identity is used, who has access to it, and when it is shared.

With BitRegalo-F1, your identity becomes your most valuable digital asset—secure, private, and uniquely yours. The protocol’s implementation of DID not only enhances security but also empowers users to interact in the digital world with confidence and autonomy.

2.1.2 KYC Tag with Zero Knowledge Proof

Security and compliance are critical, especially in environments where trust is paramount. BitRegalo-F1 integrates a robust KYC (Know Your Customer) process, but with a twist—privacy is preserved through the use of Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP). The KYC Tag in BitRegalo-F1 acts as a digital badge that verifies a user’s identity without exposing any sensitive information. Here’s how it works:

KYC Verification: Users undergo a KYC process where their identity is verified against regulatory standards.
ZKP Encryption: The verified KYC information is then encrypted using Zero Knowledge Proofs, ensuring that the details remain private and off-chain.
On-Chain Tag: A KYC Tag, representing the successful verification, is stored on the blockchain. This tag is a simple, secure indicator that the user has been verified, without revealing any personal details.
This approach guarantees that users can prove their identity when required, such as during transactions or account recovery, without compromising their privacy. It’s a seamless blend of compliance and security, designed to meet the highest standards without intruding on the user’s personal data.

2.2 Passkey Authentication

2.2.1 Passkey as a DevicePasswords have long been the weak link in digital security. They are vulnerable to theft, easy to forget, and often the first point of failure in securing digital identities. BitRegalo-F1 eliminates the need for traditional passwords by introducing Passkey Authentication.A Passkey is a physical or digital device that provides secure access to your accounts and digital assets. With a passkey, you don’t need to remember complex passwords or rely on potentially insecure second-factor authentication methods. Instead, your passkey becomes your access key, stored securely either in a physical device or a digital wallet.

Secure Access: The passkey interacts directly with the blockchain, providing instant and secure access to your accounts.
No Passwords Needed: Accessing your digital identity or assets is as simple as using your passkey—no passwords required.
Portable and Secure: Passkeys can be securely stored on physical devices (like a hardware token) or within a digital wallet, ensuring they are both accessible and protected.
This system not only enhances security but also simplifies the user experience. No more forgotten passwords or failed login attempts—just secure, straightforward access to everything you need.2.2.2 Social Recovery MechanismEven with the best security measures, things can go wrong—passkeys can be lost, devices can fail, and accounts can be compromised. BitRegalo-F1 addresses these scenarios with a Social Recovery Mechanism that blends security with community trust.

Nomination of Trusted Users: Users can nominate a select group of trusted individuals (family members, close friends, or business partners) who can assist in account recovery if access is lost.
Verified Social Recovery: These trusted users must be verified through the decentralized identity system, ensuring that only legitimate individuals can participate in the recovery process.
Temporary Key Generation: During the recovery process, a temporary private/public key pair is generated. This key is used to securely manage the recovery without compromising the original account security.
Majority Consent: The nominated users must reach a consensus to confirm the identity of the user and approve the recovery. Once this consensus is reached, the account is restored to the rightful owner, and the temporary keys are discarded.
This method ensures that even if you lose access to your passkey or device, you can regain control of your account securely and without relying on any centralized authority.

2.3 Request for Proposal (RFP) & Request to Supply (RTS)

2.3.1 RFP ProcessThe Request for Proposal (RFP) process within BitRegalo-F1 is designed to be as flexible as it is secure. Whether you’re an individual user or part of an entity, creating an RFP is straightforward and comes with advanced features that streamline the procurement process.

Individual RFPs: Users can create RFPs tied directly to their personal identity. These RFPs are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability throughout the process.

Entity-Based RFPs: If you’re operating within an entity, RFPs can be created under that entity’s identity, allowing for collaborative management and governance.

Dual Authorization: Within entities, dual authorization is required for awarding proposals. This means that multiple users (e.g., two or three) must approve any decisions related to the RFP, ensuring that no single individual can unilaterally commit the entity to an agreement.

2.3.2 RTS ProcessThe Request to Supply (RTS) feature complements the RFP process by focusing on supply chain interactions. It allows businesses to request supplies or offer services, with a strong emphasis on security and trust.

Customization: Like RFPs, RTSs can be customized to fit specific business needs, from simple supply requests to complex service agreements.

Escrow Issuance by Interactor: In the RTS process, the interactor (typically the bidder or supplier) issues the escrow. This ensures that the party responsible for fulfilling the request has a stake in the transaction, enhancing trust and commitment.

By combining RFPs and RTSs, BitRegalo-F1 offers a comprehensive solution for managing both the procurement and supply sides of business operations, all within a secure, decentralized framework.
